# Project title:
  Email spam classifier


# introduction:
  A machine learning project to detect whether an email is **spam** or **ham** (not spam) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms.
  Email spam filtering is a classic yet essential problem in text classification, widely used in real-world email services. This project walks through building a spam filter from scratch using Python, Scikit-learn, and NLP tools. Itâ€™s a great introduction to text preprocessing, vectorization, and machine learning model building.


# Features:
- Preprocessing of email text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF
- Multiple ML models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN_classifier,Random_forest_classifier..etc
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

# Tech Stack:

 - Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy** for text preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  for visualization

# Sample Output:
Confusion Matrix
Accuracy / Precision / Recall scores
Example predictions on test data

# Future Work:
Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
Integrate LSTM / transformer-based models
Use a larger real-world dataset (e.g., Enron)
